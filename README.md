**Chunk Loaders** allows you keep chunks loaded with **different tiers of chunk loaders**!
**Individual chunks** can be loaded though **a map** and the chunk loaders can load chunks in up to a **7 by 7 area**.
Chunks loaded by the chunkÂ loaders will also receive **random ticks**, so **crops, sugar cane and trees will keep growing**.
